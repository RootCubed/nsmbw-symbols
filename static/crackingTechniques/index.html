    <h1>NSMBW hash cracking techniques</h1>

    <p>
        This site contains various techniques that can be used to crack the hashes of NSMBW symbols.
        The hashing function that is used is also known as djb2 and a C implementation is shown below.
        For every symbol, we have the hash of the mangled and demangled version. This leads to many pairs of related inputs.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-c">uint32_t hash(char * s, uint32_t h = 0x1505) {
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(s); i++) {
        h = (33 * h) ^ s[i];
    }

    return h;
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        Note that we have
        <pre><code class="language-plaintext">hash(a + b, seed) == hash(b, hash(a, seed));</code></pre>
        for any strings <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and any integer <code>seed</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Inverse hash function</h2>
    <h3>Theory</h3>
    An XOR operation can easily be inverted, simply by performing it again.
    However, it turns out the multiplication by 33 can also be inverted.
    The reason for this is that 33 and 2<sup>32</sup> do not share any prime factors (since 33 is odd).
    From modular arithmetic, we know an inverse must exist. In this case, it's 1041204193 (or <code>0x3e0f83e1</code>).
    As such, we can use the following algorithm to get the hash of a prefix.

    <pre><code class="language-c">uint32_t inverse_hash(char * s, uint32_t h) {
    for (int i = strlen(s) - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        h = 1041204193 * (s[i] ^ h);
    }

    return h;
}</code></pre>
    
    <p>
        Note that we have
        <pre><code class="language-plaintext">hash(a, seed) == inverse_hash(b, hash(a + b, seed));</code></pre>
        for any strings <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and any integer <code>seed</code>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Application</h3>
    For a hash where where the last <code>n</code> characters are known, this insight allows us to retrieve the hash of the remaining unknown plaintext.
    <br>
    For example, if we know a symbol ends with the string "abc", the hash of the unknown part before that can be retrieved by using
    <code>inverse_hash("abc", &lt;hash_value&gt;)</code>.

    <h2>XOR trick</h2>
    <h3>Theory</h3>
    We can observe that the result of the hash function is equivalent the XOR of all the characters and the seed value modulo 32.
    This is because the update step <code>(33 * h) ^ s[i]</code> is equivalent to <code>(1 * h) ^ s[i]</code> modulo 32.
    <p>
        We have
        <pre><code class="language-plaintext">hash(a, seed) % 32 == XOR(a[0], ..., a[n], seed) % 32;</code></pre>
        for any string <code>a</code> and any integer <code>seed</code>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Application</h3>
    <p>
        This trick is helpful in gathering information about the namespace/class of a symbol by making use of the mangled/demangled representation of a symbol.
        Assuming the mangled hash looks like <code>func__5ClassFv</code> in mangled form, and <code>Class::func( void )</code> in demangled form,
        we can XOR the hashes of the mangled and demangled symbol together and look at the result modulo 32.
        <br>

        First, note that all characters that occur in both strings (or twice in one of the strings) cancel each other out because of the property <code>a ^ a = 0</code>.
        So, we actually have 
        <pre><code class="language-plaintext">hash("func__5ClassFv") ^ hash("Class::func( void )") % 32
== (XOR("func__5ClassFv") ^ XOR("Class::func( void )")) % 32
== XOR("func__5ClassFvClass::func( void )") % 32
== XOR("__5Fv::( void )") % 32</code></pre>

        If we XOR this with <code>__Fv::( void )</code>, we can obtain the XOR of the class name length, in this case <code>'5' % 32 = 0x15</code>.

        Note that the use of this technique requires assumptions on the underlying symbol, such as whether nested classes or templates are involved,
        or whether the function is static, the types of the arguments, etc. Importantly however, neither knowledge about the class name nor the function name is required.

        <br><br>
        Example:
        <br>
        Given the hashes <code>M = 0x93feaef0</code> and <code>D = 0xc1ff43a0</code>, we try to find the length of the class name.
        We assume that the function has no arguments, is not a constant function, and not a static function either.

        <pre><code class="language-plaintext">M = hash(plaintext_M) == 0x93feaef0 // plaintext_M is of the form "func_name__?ClassNameFv"
D = hash(plaintext_D) == 0xc1ff43a0 // plaintext_D is of the form "ClassName::func_name( void )"

// (M ^ D) % 32 == XOR("__Fv::( void )" + "&lt;class name length&gt;") % 32

(M ^ D ^ XOR("__Fv::( void )")) % 32 == 0x15</code></pre>

        Assuming ? consists solely of digits, the upper nybble of the result can only be 1 if there is an odd number of digits. Since a class name with a length of 3 digits is rather unlikely, this result indicates the class length is probably 5.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Known middle part attack</h2>
    If two hashes have the same unknown prefix, a known middle part (which is different for the two hashes) and then an unknown suffix (same for both hashes again),
    this trick can gather information about the unknown common suffix.
    <h3>Theory</h3>
    
    (TODO)

    <h3>Application</h3>
    This trick was used to find the name of the <code>fBase_c::MAIN_STATE_e</code> argument, that was deemed impossible to find
    (more about this <a href="https://wuffs.org/blog/reversing-games-with-hashcat">here</a>).
    Additionally, it was used to find the names of the functions <code>XXX_classInit()</code> functions, previously named <code>XXX::build()</code>.
    <br>
    This technique can be quite useful if you know two functions from different classes have the same function name and arguments
    (for example because they are virtual functions and one overrides the other), but you only know the name of the classes they belong to.
    
    <h2>Possible future techniques</h2>
    Z3 seems to be able to tell if an unknown part of a string has the correct length mod 2. Maybe figuring out how it does this can lead to new insights.
